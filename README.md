# Overview

I have made 2d games before. This was my first try at creating a 3d game. I do not have enough time to finish it quite yet.
I used a tutorial from the panda3d website to create the environment and the first panda. I then added more pandas that were
different sizes and ran at different speeds. Right now I was not able to add any of my own models or create the 'game' part
of the game.

The ability to move the camera is added to the game using the mouse. Left click moves side to side, right click zooms in and out, and the middle mouse button rotates the view.

My game at the moment has no purpose.

I wrote this software to get more experience with programming games and to understand how 3d graphics work.

# Development Environment

For this program I used the Spyder debugging software. It works similar to programs like visual studio.

I used python as my programming language, the Panda3d module for game rendering, and github for source control.

# Future Work

* Add better camera controls, allowing the user to move as if they were a panda
* Add my own models and actors
* Make the game more interractive
