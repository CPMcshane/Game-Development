# Overview

I have made 2d games before. This was my first try at creating a 3d game. I do not have enough time to finish it quite yet.
I used a tutorial from the panda3d website to create the environment and the first panda. I then added more pandas that were
different sizes and ran at different speeds. Right now I was not able to add any of my own models or create the 'game' part
of the game.

My game at the moment has no purpose.

I wrote this software to get more experience with programming games and to understand how 3d graphics work.

# Development Environment

For this program I used the Spyder debugging software. It works similar to programs like visual studio.

I used python as my programming language, the Panda3d module for game rendering, and github for source control.

# Future Work

* Add better camera controls, allowing the user to move as if they were a panda
* Add my own models and actors
* Make the game more interractive
